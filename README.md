# Stan-models

This is a collection of Stan models I have written.

- Gaussian mixture model with non-exchangeable priors for proper mixing
- Gaussian mixture regression
- 1-D MRF with a smoothing prior to model pixel profiles
- Conjugate model for multinomial
- Non-conjugate model for multinomial to allow covariance modelling
- Hierarchical non-conjugate multinomial to model group-level effects
